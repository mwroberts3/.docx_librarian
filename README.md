.docx Librarian is a web app designed to help split and categorize larger .docx. files

## Usage

.docx Librarian will split up a document into separate, sortable categories if the said document file abides by a specific template, which is discussed in the app's documentation.

The purpose of this app is to assist research, regardless of the topic. Could be helpful for a student doing general research. If writing a paper about a broad topic, all the research entries can go into one large .docx file and then be sort according to topic after research is done.

Could potentially be useful for fiction writers or general world-builders who prefer to store all their new thoughts an data into a single document rather than have numerous ones. So, when inspiration strikes, no thought has to be put into what document to add an idea to.

## Version History

**1.0.0 - 11/25/20**
<br>

- Basic functionality is intact, users can upload documents and either do a simple search or use the template to edit categories and save new .docx files.

## Roadmap

- Would like to beef up the simple search and add new features. So far there is no reason, you'd use .docx Librarian to search over the word processer used to write the document in the first place.
